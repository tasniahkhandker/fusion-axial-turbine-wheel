# fusion-axial-turbine-wheel
3D CAD model of an axial turbine wheel featuring multiple curved blades arranged around a central hub.
The blades are evenly spaced and shaped to guide fluid or airflow efficiently from the outer radius toward the center.
The integrated hub includes a central bore for shaft mounting, making the design suitable for small turbine, blower, or turbo-machinery concepts.
Intended for CAD practice, prototyping, and educational exploration of turbine and fluid-flow design principles.
